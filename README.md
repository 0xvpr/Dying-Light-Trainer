## What I Learned
 [ TODO ]

## How It Works
Use any DLL injector that you are comfortable with to inject the daylight-savings.dll into  
the <code>DyingLightGame.exe</code> process. 

Once the DLL is injected, you will have access to the following Hacks:
- [x] F1: God Mode
- [x] F2: One shot kill
- [x] F3: Infinite Stamina
- [ ] F4: Noclip
- [ ] F5: Flash (5x Speed)

### Windows

#### Visual Studio
